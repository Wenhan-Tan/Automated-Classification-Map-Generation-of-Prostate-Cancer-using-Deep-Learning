# Automated-Classification-Map-Generation-of-Prostate-Cancer-using-Deep-Learning
Here is the original code which you can use to reproduce entire results. Some scripts are for testing codes only.  
There are 7 steps:

1. Clean_data.py
2. Extract_patches.py
3. Train_test_validation_spilt.py
4. Train.py
5. Save_slideFolders_mask_image.py
6. Save_slideFolders_classification_result.py
7. Output_quadratic_kappa.py

You can find these scripts in this repository. All 7 scripts have detailed header if you want to know more about how each script works.
